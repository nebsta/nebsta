I'm an Aussie software engineer, currently woring at Trustpilot. Mainly work in mobile/game development.

In my spare time I like to work on my [C++ gaming engine](https://github.com/nebsta/grumble), [personal website](https://github.com/nebsta/coffee-coder), or anything else that interests me. 

I post most of my updates and other random things on my 🐦 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheCaffCoder)
